They must receive large amounts of data every microsecond\n\n2. They must be able to act extremely fast on the received data because profitable opportunities disappear quickly! \n\nHFT problems are also online problems in the sense that not all of the data used in their decision making is available to them at once. \n\nSince HFT problems need to be able to react to market updates quickly, they need very efficient memory handling, which can only be achieved if the amount of memory used is small. \n\nOne Pass Algorithms\n\nBased on the speed requirement and the online nature of HFT problems, the class of one-pass algorithms is especially suitable for HFT applications. These algorithms receive one data point at a time and use it to update a set of factors. After the update, the data point is discarded and only the updated factors are kept in memory."

Now, as you may guess, the moving average can only be implemented as a two-pass algorithm because you have to view each data point twice - once when you add it to the moving average and once when you remove it from the moving average. \n\nLet's implement this below: "

How can we approximate the moving average with a one-pass algorithm?\n\nWhat if we downweighted points that we saw in the distance past? \n\nThis type of downweighting is called the one-pass exponential weighted average. Essentially, we are multiplying all of the points in the past by an alpha every single time we see a new point. As a result, points in the distance past contribute less to the average than points closer to the present. \n\nLet's implement this below: "
